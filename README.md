- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @1984Macintosh
  
Iâ€™m interested in almost everything that involves computers and technolgy. By the time I am writing this discription, I'm finishing my bachelor degree in Network Engineering at the University of Brasilia, Brazil, and working at Banco do Brasil as a software developer. 

I enjoy studying mainly topics envolving networking, micro processors, cryptography, telecommunications and programming in general (especially C++, Java and low level programming).

When I'm not studying computer science, I enjoy movies, playing videogames or reading books/mangas/comic books.

I'll probably forget to update this later, but I bet you all can see by my text that I'm not good writing tinder bios too. Xd
